        Unfortunately, most people are glued to their smartphones. Here are some worrying statistics about smartphone usage:
    
        46% of smartphone users spend between 5–6 hours per day on their smartphone
        The average adult spends 3 hours and 54 minutes on their mobile devices per day
        On average, we pick up our smartphones between 150–344 times per day (that’s once every 4 minutes)
        During the pandemic, daily smartphone usage has nearly doubled among children
        Fortunately, one of the most effective ways to spend less time on your smartphone is to have a clear list of productive, healthy, and fulfilling replacement activities.
    
        The more you practice these replacement activities, the less time you’ll waste on your smartphone.
    
        Learning New Skills
        Most people claim they ‘don’t have enough time’ to learn new skills or read more books. This is a lazy excuse. The problem is not lack of time, it’s lack of time management. Each day, hours are being wasted on distractions and low-quality entertainment.
    
        As Richard Koch, author of The 80/20 Principle, said, “It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways.”
    
        What if each day, you traded 30 minutes of mindless phone scrolling for 30 minutes of learning a new skill?
    
        Whether learning high-value skills to make more money, new languages to emerge yourself in different cultures, or party tricks to show off to your friends, there are dozens of skills to learn.
    
        Where scrolling through your phone provides a temporary high — the dopamine spike is short-lived — learning a new skill will stick with you for years, if not an entire lifetime.`,

        During the pandemic, daily smartphone usage has nearly doubled among children
        Fortunately, one of the most effective ways to spend less time on your smartphone is to have a clear list of productive, healthy, and fulfilling replacement activities.
    
        The more you practice these replacement activities, the less time you’ll waste on your smartphone.
    
        Learning New Skills
        Most people claim they ‘don’t have enough time’ to learn new skills or read more books. This is a lazy excuse. The problem is not lack of time, it’s lack of time management. Each day, hours are being wasted on distractions and low-quality entertainment.
    
        As Richard Koch, author of The 80/20 Principle, said, “It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways.”
    
        What if each day, you traded 30 minutes of mindless phone scrolling for 30 minutes of learning a new skill?
    
        Whether learning high-value skills to make more money, new languages to emerge yourself in different cultures, or party tricks to show off to your friends, there are dozens of skills to learn.
    
        Where scrolling through your phone provides a temporary high — the dopamine spike is short-lived — learning a new skill will stick with you for years, if not an entire lifetime.`,
